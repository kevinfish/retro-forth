Retro Language
--------------
This is a virtual machine and modules for using Retro on an mbed development
board. The mbed board used is the LPC1768, which has an ARM processor, 32 KiB
of RAM, and 512 KiB of flash memory. The CPU is a Cortex-M3, running at 96MHz,
so it's fast enough for most purposes.

Current Features
----------------
* 16-bit image
* 10,333 cells consumed for image + buffers (thanks to ^diet'extreme)
* About 3,500 cells free for user-level code
* File I/O support off of mbed filesystem
* Image fits (up to 14,000 cells) in RAM

Known Bugs:

  time query is broken; it's fudged to return semi-workable values to let it
  work for simple timing loops and pass the test suite
