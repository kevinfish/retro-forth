Rosetta Code
============
Rosetta Code is a website that provides comparisons in implementation of common
tasks across a variety of languages. This directory contains the Retro code for
these examples.

Please note that many of these will have textual comments added; they are intended
for study, not running directly.

If you make changes here, please update the appropriate pages on the rosettacode.org
site to reflect them.
