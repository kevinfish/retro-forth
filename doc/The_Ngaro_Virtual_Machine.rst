=========================
The Ngaro Virtual Machine
=========================


--------
Abstract
--------
Ngaro is a minimalistic virtual machine emulating a dual stack computer with
a simple instruction set and a few basic I/O devices.

At present, there are full implementations in Assembly (x86), C, F#, Go, Common
Lisp, PHP, Python, and Ruby, and minimal implementations in C#, Forth, Lua, JavaScript,
Java, Perl, and Scheme.


-------------
Memory Access
-------------
Ngaro provides a memory space consisting of 32-bit, signed integer values.
The first address is mapped to zero, with subsequent values following in a
strictly linear fashion.

Each addressable 32-bit unit is called a *cell*. There is no support in the
instruction set for accessing values larger or smaller than a single cell.


---------
Registers
---------
Ngaro exposes no registers directly.


------
Stacks
------
Ngaro emulates two LIFO stacks. The primary one is the *data stack*, and
serves as a place for holding data, and passing data between instructions.

The other is the *address stack*, which is used to hold return addresses from
calls, and can be used to temporarily hold small amounts of data.

The current depth of a stack can be determined by using the I/O ports to
query the VM.

A standard implementation will provide at least 128 cells for data stack, and
1024 for the address stack.


-----------
Image Files
-----------
On startup, Ngaro will load an *image file*. This is a flat, linear array of
signed integer values. On disk, images are stored in little endian format, but
the VM may convert them to big endian internally.

If an implementation uses big endian internally, this must be reported via the
queries I/O port.

The first value loaded is mapped to address zero, and subsequent values are
loaded to sequential addresses in the Ngaro memory space.

An image file does not contain copies of the stacks or any internal registers
used by the VM.


---------
I/O Ports
---------
Interfacing with the underlying OS and hardware devices is done by reading and
writing I/O ports.

Ports 0 - 12 are reserved for current and future standard I/O devices. A VM
may provide non-standard devices on port numbers above or below this range.

+------+-----------------------+
| Port | Used For              |
+======+=======================+
| 0    | Triggering I/O events |
+------+-----------------------+
| 1    | Keyboard              |
+------+-----------------------+
| 2    | Text Output           |
+------+-----------------------+
| 3    | Force Video Update    |
+------+-----------------------+
| 4    | File I/O              |
+------+-----------------------+
| 5    | Querying the VM       |

| 6    | Canvas                |
+------+-----------------------+
| 7    | Mouse                 |
+------+-----------------------+


Port 0: Wait for Hardware Event
===============================
This port is used to synchronize communication between the ngaro and
the virtual hardware devices.

See the description of the WAIT opcode for details.

Usage Example:

::

  #0 #0 out, wait,


Port 1: Read from the Keyboard
==============================
To read a value from the keyboard, set port 1 to 1, wait for an I/O event,
then read the key value from port 1.

Usage Example:

::

  #1 #1 out,
  #0 #0 out, wait,
  #1 in,


Port 2: Character Generator
===========================
Ngaro provides a hardware character generator. This takes data off the stack,
so you should make sure the character value is *on the stack* before using it.
To use this, write the value 1 to port 2 and wait for an I/O event.

When a negative value is passed, the VM should clear the screen and position
the cursor in the upper left corner.

Usage Example:

::

  #98 #1 #2 out,
  #0 #0 out, wait,


Port 3: Force Video Update
==========================
To help improve performance, an Ngaro implementation is permitted to cache
output and update the display periodically. For implementations that do this,
seting this port will force an immediate update.

An implementation that caches output must check this routinely, and respond
immediately. No waiting for an I/O event is neccessary for this.

Example:

::

  #0 #3 out,


Port 4: File Operations
=======================
If your Ngaro implementation allows saving images, you can use this port
to do so. To save, set port 4 to 1 and *wait*.

Other operations can be done using negative values, if the VM supports this.
To use these, setup the stack, write the operation code to port 4, *wait*,
then read the value back in from port 4.

+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| Op   | Takes                 | Returns | Notes                           |
+======+=======================+=========+=================================+
|  1   | -                     | 0       | Save the image                  |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
|  2   | filename              | 0       | Include a file ( like --with )  |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| -1   | filename, mode        | handle  | Open a file                     |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| -2   | handle                | byte    | Read a byte from a file         |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| -3   | character, handle     | flag    | Write a byte to a file          |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| -4   | handle                | flag    | Close a file                    |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| -5   | handle                | offset  | Return current location in file |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| -6   | offset, handle        | flag    | Seek a new location in file     |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| -7   | handle                | size    | Return the size of a file       |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+
| -8   | filename              | flag    | Delete a file.                  |
+------+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+

Valid modes for opening files are:

+-------+----------------------------+-------------------------+
| Value | Used For                   | Create if not existing? |
+=======+============================+=========================+
| 0     | Open file for reading      | No                      |
+-------+----------------------------+-------------------------+
| 1     | Open file for writing      | Yes                     |
+-------+----------------------------+-------------------------+
| 2     | Open file for append       | Yes                     |
+-------+----------------------------+-------------------------+
| 3     | Open file for modification | No                      |
+-------+----------------------------+-------------------------+

Reading and modification should *not* create a file if none exist. Writing
and append modes *should* create a file if it does not exist.

The write mode should create a new file, removing the contents of existing
files with the same name.

The append mode should set the file read/write position to the end of the
file.

If opening fails, the returned handle should be zero. Any non-zero handle
is considered valid.

When closing a valid handle, *close* should return zero.

The *write* operation should return a value of 1. Any other value indicates
an error.

The *delete* operation should return -1 if the file is deleted, or 0 if
the deletion fails.


Port 5: Queries Into the VM Devices
===================================
Set port 5 to one of the following values; wait; then read the result back.

+-------+---------------------------------------+
| value | returns                               |
+=======+=======================================+
| -1    | Memory Size                           |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -2    | Does a Canvas device exist?           |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -3    | Canvas Width                          |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -4    | Canvas Height                         |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -5    | Data Stack Depth                      |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -6    | Address Stack Depth                   |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -7    | Does a Mouse device exist?            |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -8    | Current time (in seconds, Unix-style) |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -9    | Exit the VM                           |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -10   | Query for an enivronment variable     |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -11   | Console Width                         |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -12   | Console Height                        |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -13   | Number of bits per cell               |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -14   | 0 for little endian, 1 for big endian |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -15   | -1 if Port 8 enabled, 0 if disabled   |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -16   | Return max depth of data stack        |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| -17   | Return max depth of address stack     |
+-------+---------------------------------------+

At a minimum, an implementation must provide support for -1, -5, -6, -8, and -9.

For -5 and -6, "depth" refers to the number of items on the specified stack.

For -10, the application must provide a buffer address on the stack, and a
pointer to a string. The VM should search the system environment for the
string and copy its value to the application memory, starting at the provided
buffer address. If an environment variable is not found, the VM should store a
value of zero in the provided buffer address.

For -13, if the returned value is zero, the image can assume a 32-bit environment.

For -14, if the VM is using big endian internally, this should return a value of 1.


Port 6: Canvas
==============
Some Ngaro implementations allow for drawing to a *canvas* device. Setup
the data stack as shown in the table, and write the appropriate values
to port 6.

*This device is optional.*

+-------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

| 3     | xyhw- | draw a rectangle of specified width (w) and height (h). The |
|       |       | top corner is denoted by the x, y pair                      |
+-------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4     | xyhw- | draw a filled rectangle of specified width (w) and height   |
|       |       | (h). The top corner is denoted by the x, y pair             |
+-------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5     | xyh-  | draw a vertical line of height (h) starting at x, y         |
+-------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6     | xyw-  | draw a horizontal line of width (w) starting at x, y        |
+-------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7     | xyw-  | draw a circle of width (w) starting at x, y                 |
+-------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8     | xyw-  | draw a filled circle of width (w) starting at x, y          |
+-------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Port 7: Mouse
=============
Set port 7 to one of the following values and wait. The results will be
pushed to the data stack.

*This device is optional.*

+-------+---------------------------------------+
| value | returns                               |
+=======+=======================================+
| 1     | Mouse X and Y coordinates. Y will be  |
|       | on TOS when done. X will be NOS.      |
+-------+---------------------------------------+
| 2     | Is mouse button pressed? 0 = false,   |
|       | non-zero is true. True values *may*   |
|       | indicate the button being pressed, but|
|       | this is not required.                 |
+-------+---------------------------------------+


Port 8: Enhanced Text Console
=============================
Set port 8 to one of the following values and wait.

*This device is optional.*

Due to platform constraints, implementations may not offer all of these
functions. An implementation providing this port should at least support
cursor positioning. *Any non-implemented functions should be silently
ignored.*

An implementation may provide additional, non-standard functionality
using negative values.

+-------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| value | stack | action                                                 |

Instruction Processing
======================
The instruction pointer is incremented, then the opcode at the current address
is handled. Execution ends when the instruction pointer is greater than the
end of the simulated memory space.

A psuedocode in Retro:

::

  -1 !ip
  [ ip ++ processOpcode @ip 1000000 < ] while

And in Lua:

::

  ip = 0
  while ip < 1000000 do
    processOpcode()
    ip = ip + 1
  end


The Instructions
================


Opcode 0: NOP
-------------
Does nothing.


Opcode 1: LIT
-------------
Push the value in the following memory location to the data stack. Advances
the instruction pointer by one.

In memory this might appear as:

::

  0000 LIT
  0001 101

After LIT executes, the IP would be set at 0001, and the top item on the
data stack would be 101.


Opcode 2: DUP
-------------
Make a duplicate copy of the top item on the data stack and push the copy to
the data stack.

+--------+-------+
| before | after |
+========+=======+
|        | +---+ |
|        | | 1 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 1 |  | | 1 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 2 |  | | 2 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 3 |  | | 3 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
+--------+-------+


Opcode 3: DROP
--------------
Remove the top item from the data stack.

+--------+-------+
| before | after |
+========+=======+
| +---+  |       |
| | 1 |  |       |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 2 |  | | 2 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 3 |  | | 3 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
+--------+-------+


Opcode 4: SWAP
--------------
Remove the top two items from the stack, and push them back in the reverse
order.

+--------+-------+
| before | after |
+========+=======+
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 1 |  | | 2 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 2 |  | | 1 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 3 |  | | 3 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
+--------+-------+


Opcode 5: PUSH
--------------
Remove the top item from the data stack, and push it to the address stack.

+--------+-------+
| before | after |
+========+=======+
| +---+  |       |
| | 1 |  |       |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 2 |  | | 2 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 3 |  | | 3 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
+--------+-------+


Opcode 6: POP
-------------
Remove the top item from the address stack, and push it to the data stack.

+--------+-------+
| before | after |
+========+=======+
|        | +---+ |
|        | | 1 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 2 |  | | 2 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 3 |  | | 3 | |
| +---+  | +---+ |
+--------+-------+


Opcode 7: LOOP
--------------
Decrement the top value on the stack and advance the instruction pointer. If
the top item on the stack is greater than zero, jump to the address following
the LOOP instruction, otherwise discard the top item on the stack and continue
execution normally.


Opcode 8: JUMP
--------------
Set the instruction pointer to the address in the cell following the JUMP
instruction.

This instruction needs to decrement the requested address by one to
account for the increment of the instruction pointer by the opcode process
cycle. E.g., if the jump target is 1234, JUMP needs to set the instruction
pointer to 1233.

To improve performance, this instruction may skip leading NOP's at the
destination address.


Opcode 9: RETURN
----------------
Return from a call to a subroutine. This will pop the return address from
the address stack, and set the instruction pointer to it.


Opcode 10: LT_JUMP
------------------
Increment the instruction pointer.

Pop the top two values from the stack. If the first stack item is less than
the second item, set the instruction pointer to the address stored at the
memory location following this instruction. If not, continue execution.

This instruction needs to decrement the requested address by one to
account for the increment of the instruction pointer by the opcode process
cycle. E.g., if the jump target is 1234, the instruction pointer should be
set to 1233.

In memory, this will be stored as:

::

  0000 LT_JUMP
  0001 destination

+--------+-------+


Opcode 11: GT_JUMP
------------------
Increment the instruction pointer.

Pop the top two values from the stack. If the first stack item is greater than
the second item, set the instruction pointer to the address stored at the
memory location following this instruction. If not, continue execution.

This instruction needs to decrement the requested address by one to
account for the increment of the instruction pointer by the opcode process
cycle. E.g., if the jump target is 1234, the instruction pointer should be
set to 1233.

In memory, this will be stored as:

Opcode 12: NE_JUMP
------------------
Increment the instruction pointer.

Pop the top two values from the stack. If the first stack item is not equal to
the second item, set the instruction pointer to the address stored at the
memory location following this instruction. If not, continue execution.

This instruction needs to decrement the requested address by one to
account for the increment of the instruction pointer by the opcode process
cycle. E.g., if the jump target is 1234, the instruction pointer should be
set to 1233.

In memory, this will be stored as:

Opcode 13: EQ_JUMP
------------------
Increment the instruction pointer.

Pop the top two values from the stack. If the first stack item is equal to
the second item, set the instruction pointer to the address stored at the
memory location following this instruction. If not, continue execution.

This instruction needs to decrement the requested address by one to
account for the increment of the instruction pointer by the opcode process
cycle. E.g., if the jump target is 1234, the instruction pointer should be
set to 1233.

In memory, this will be stored as:

Opcode 14: FETCH
----------------
Remove the top item from the data stack. Lookup the value stored in the memory
address this value points to, and push the value read to the data stack.

Assuming that memory at 1234 contains 45:

+----------+--------+
| before   | after  |
+==========+========+

| | 1234 | | | 45 | |
| +------+ | +----+ |
+----------+--------+


Opcode 15: STORE
----------------

| +---+  | +---+ |
+--------+-------+


Opcode 28: IN
-------------
Take a value from the data stack. Read the value stored in the I/O port
corresponding to the value read from the stack, and push this value to
the data stack.

After reading, set the value of the port read to zero.

+--------+-------+
| before | after |
+========+=======+
| +---+  | +---+ |
| | 1 |  | | ? | |
| +---+  | +---+ |

The value returned will vary depending on the I/O device subsystem and
specific port requested.


Opcode 29: OUT
--------------
Take two values off the data stack. The top value will be an I/O port number,
and the second will be a value. Store the value in the I/O port specified.

+--------+-------+
| before | after |
+========+=======+
| +---+  |       |
| | 2 |  |       |
| +---+  |       |
| | 1 |  |       |
| +---+  |       |
+--------+-------+

With the values in this table, port 2 would be set to a value of 1.


Opcode 30: WAIT
---------------
Run the simulated device handler, provided that port 0 is set to 0,
and at least one other port is set to a value other than 0. Otherwise,
continue execution as normal.

If the device handler runs, it will setting port 0 to 1, thus preventing
itself from running again until the code sets port 0 back to 0. Therefore,
programs should always set I/O port 0 to 0 before invoking WAIT.


Opcodes Above 30
----------------
Any opcode above 30 is treated as an *implicit call*.

The VM will push the current value of the instruction pointer to the address stack
and set the instruction pointer to the value of the opcode. Note that like jumps,
the VM must decrement this value by one to account for the increment that will happen
before the next instruction is processed.
